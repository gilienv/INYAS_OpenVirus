# The INYAS OpenVirus Initiative 

With the 2020 Global Lockdown due to the Coronvirus Pandemic, we have initiated a series of remote online internships to enable researchers in Biology to gain new skills and learn the best practices of a research environment using GitHub!   

On this page, you will find a short background on the program and relevant links to help you navigate further!

## The Idea 

## INYAS
The Indian National Young Academy of Sciences (INYAS) is the national academy of young scientists from India, aiming to give a voice to young scientists across the country. Founded in 2015 in line with Die Junge Akademie of Germany, INYAS is the apex body of young scientists from India representing all branches of science, technology and medicine. INYAS is housed within its parent body, Indian National Science Academy and is affiliated with Global Young Academy as the national young academy of India. INYAS is also a signatory of the declaration on the Core Values of Young Academies, adopted at World Science Forum, Budapest on 20 November 2019.

## KARYA (Knowledge Augmentation through Research in Young Aspirants)
In APril 2020, INYAS received a request from the Dept of Science & Technology (DST), Govt of Rajasthan under their KARYA project (Knowledge Augmentation through Research in Young Aspirants) for providing an e-internship to students studying in Undergraduate and Postgraduate State Govt. Universities, State Govt. Colleges based on their topic of interest for 4 weeks. As a member of INYAS, Gitanjali Yadab took up mentorship of six INYAS-KARYA students, the idea was to groom them for their future and provide some basic knowledge on specific topics, connect them with other PhD/Postdoctoral fellows for motivation.mentorship. 
Six students joined us in June 2020 on the Open Virus program and this page will showcase their achievements and experience!

## Summer Research Fellowships (SRFP) Program of the Indian Science Academies

The three national Science Academies in India offer several two-month Summer Fellowships to enable students/teachers (studying/teaching in India) to work with scientists associated with the three Academies during 2020. Successful Candidates are assigned to diverse laboratories after a stringent process of selection and this year, Gitanjali Yadav took up four of these candidates for the OpenVirus Program.

## Focus Area Science Technology Summer Fellowship [FAST-SF] 
With a view of enhance the spread of Science and Technology in the specific regions of the country, the Inter Academy Panel has initiated the Focus Area Science Technology Summer Fellowship [FAST-SF]. This year (2020) focus of the academies has been on the North Eastern States of the country and the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh and the FAST-SF will be for students and teachers studying/working in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. One of our OpenVirus Interns is a bright young Ph.D. student from Kashmir, Ms. Ambreen Hamdani!

## TIGR2ESS
The TIGR2ESS programme hopews to deliver our vision, in partnership with institutions in India, to improve Indian crop science and food security. 
As an effort to adapt our plans to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, whilst almost all field and lab-related work has temporarily been suspended, TIGR2ESS partnered with INYAS to address the joint challenges of continuing to conduct world-class research during lockdown and enable students to gain skills and towards this, we have extended capacity building during the lockdown. 

The Open Virus effort has enabled TIGFR2ESS to devise new research methods to facilitate engagement with communities during times of social distancing. We are open to new ideas and suggestions and will translate existing methods into accessible remote fieldwork tools, defining and developing best practice. We will also work hard to inform and shape food security and agricultural policy post-lockdown by working closely with our partners in India.

## OpenVirus

The idea of OpenVirus is to create a digital knowledge-based project (i.e. no laboratory or clinical work). 
It is open to all who are prepared to contribute components of the system.
At present, this is a huge collaboration between various partners listed above as well as others in India, U.K and around the world!

## How To Join!
All are welcome to participate. We assume a basic level of running programs (commandline, R, text editing) and - initially - won't be able to hand hold. However we know from experience that people can learn very fast, so feel free to dive in and try the tech.
Please email gy@nipgr.ac.in with your short bio including information on your coding skills.

## Skills and knowledge that you would use in OpenVirus:

Wikimedia (esp. Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiki technology, WikiJournal)

Scholarly publications including preprints

Scraping web pages and building metadata

SPARQL/RDF , XML, JSON

Textmining , supervised and unsupervised

Virology

Epidemiology

Computation

Societal aspects of disease (e.g. public health policy).

Language translation (with a scientific emphasis)

Git and Github

Open collaborative projects

Our initial framework is based on simple dictionaries and ontologies (e.f. RDF, XML), public sources of scientific articles (especially preprints and country-
specific inclusivity (e.g. Latin America , Redalyc, SciELO)). Current software is mainly Java, R, Node, Python but as the data are exposed as text files a variety of tools can be used).

## Open Notebook publication
OpenVirus is based on the Open Notebook philosophy fo Jean-Claude Bradley and implicitly of Wikimedia content and of many Free/Open Software projects. 

Everything is posted publicly as soon as it is created. That means that every iteration is visible and will almost certainly contain bugs/errors. 

Each subsequent commit fixes some of these. We know from past experience that this is the quickest way to create high-quality content and also gives a feeling of communal ownership.
