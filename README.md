# INYAS_OpenVirus

With the 2020 Global Lockdown due to the Coronvirus Pandemic, we have initiated a series of remote online internships to enable researchers in Biology to gain new skills and learn the best practices of a research environment using GitHub!   

Here is a short background on the program and relevant links to help you navigate!

The Site and the Idea

## OpenVirus

The idea of OpenVirus is to create a digital knowledge-based project (i.e. no laboratory or clinical work). 
It is open to all who are prepared to contribute components of the system.

## How To Join!
All are welcome to participate. We assume a basic level of running programs (commandline, R, text editing) and - initially - won't be able to hand hold. However we know from experience that people can learn very fast, so feel free to dive in and try the tech.
Please email gy@nipgr.ac.in with your short bio including information on your coding skills.

## Skills and knowledge that you would use in OpenVirus:

Wikimedia (esp. Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiki technology, WikiJournal)
Scholarly publications including preprints
Scraping web pages and building metadata
SPARQL/RDF , XML, JSON
Textmining , supervised and unsupervised
Virology
Epidemiology
Computation
Societal aspects of disease (e.g. public health policy).
Language translation (with a scientific emphasis)
Git and Github
Open collaborative projects
Our initial framework is based on simple dictionaries and ontologies (e.f. RDF, XML), public sources of scientific articles (especially preprints and country-specific inclusivity (e.g. Latin America , Redalyc, SciELO)). Current software is mainly Java, R, Node, Python but as the data are exposed as text files a variety of tools can be used).

## Open Notebook publication
We are using the Open Notebook philosophy fo Jean-Claude Bradley and implicitly of Wikimedia content and of many Free/Open Software projects. Everything is posted publicly as soon as it is created. That means that every iteration is visible and will almost certainly contain bugs/errors. Each subsequent commit fixes some of these. We know from past experience that this is the quickest way to create high-quality content and also gives a feeling of communal ownership.
