# INYAS_OpenVirus

With the 2020 Global Lockdown due to the Coronvirus Pandemic, we have initiated a series of remote online internships to enable researchers in Biology to gain new skills and learn the best practices of a research environment using GitHub!   

Here is a short background on the program and relevant links to help you navigate!

The Site and the Idea 

## INYAS
The Indian National Young Academy of Sciences (INYAS) is the national academy of young scientists from India, aiming to give a voice to young scientists across the country. Founded in 2015 in line with Die Junge Akademie of Germany, INYAS is the apex body of young scientists from India representing all branches of science, technology and medicine. INYAS is housed within its parent body, Indian National Science Academy and is affiliated with Global Young Academy as the national young academy of India. INYAS is also a signatory of the declaration on the Core Values of Young Academies, adopted at World Science Forum, Budapest on 20 November 2019.

## KARYA (Knowledge Augmentation through Research in Young Aspirants)
In APril 2020, INYAS received a request from the Dept of Science & Technology (DST), Govt of Rajasthan under their KARYA project (Knowledge Augmentation through Research in Young Aspirants) for providing an e-internship to students studying in Undergraduate and Postgraduate State Govt. Universities, State Govt. Colleges based on their topic of interest for 4 weeks. As a member of INYAS, Gitanjali Yadab took up mentorship of six INYAS-KARYA students, the idea was to groom them for their future and provide some basic knowledge on specific topics, connect them with other PhD/Postdoctoral fellows for motivation.mentorship. 
Six students joined us in June 2020 on the Open Virus program and this page will showcase their achievements and experience!

## OpenVirus

The idea of OpenVirus is to create a digital knowledge-based project (i.e. no laboratory or clinical work). 
It is open to all who are prepared to contribute components of the system.

## How To Join!
All are welcome to participate. We assume a basic level of running programs (commandline, R, text editing) and - initially - won't be able to hand hold. However we know from experience that people can learn very fast, so feel free to dive in and try the tech.
Please email gy@nipgr.ac.in with your short bio including information on your coding skills.

## Skills and knowledge that you would use in OpenVirus:

Wikimedia (esp. Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiki technology, WikiJournal)
Scholarly publications including preprints
Scraping web pages and building metadata
SPARQL/RDF , XML, JSON
Textmining , supervised and unsupervised
Virology
Epidemiology
Computation
Societal aspects of disease (e.g. public health policy).
Language translation (with a scientific emphasis)
Git and Github
Open collaborative projects
Our initial framework is based on simple dictionaries and ontologies (e.f. RDF, XML), public sources of scientific articles (especially preprints and country-specific inclusivity (e.g. Latin America , Redalyc, SciELO)). Current software is mainly Java, R, Node, Python but as the data are exposed as text files a variety of tools can be used).

## Open Notebook publication
We are using the Open Notebook philosophy fo Jean-Claude Bradley and implicitly of Wikimedia content and of many Free/Open Software projects. Everything is posted publicly as soon as it is created. That means that every iteration is visible and will almost certainly contain bugs/errors. Each subsequent commit fixes some of these. We know from past experience that this is the quickest way to create high-quality content and also gives a feeling of communal ownership.
